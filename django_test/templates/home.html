<h1>About:</h1>
<p>This is the source code of the project of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-python-django/#/">"Learn Python Django for Beginners"</a> course at <a href="https://udemy.com">https://udemy.com</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the course gives a very good base that you can step on and furthermore it is free!</p>
